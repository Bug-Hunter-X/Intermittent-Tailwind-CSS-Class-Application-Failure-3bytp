This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes intermittently fail to apply to elements within a specific component. The bug is seemingly random and persists even after cleaning the build and restarting the development server. The solution involves carefully inspecting the HTML structure for potential conflicts or unintended overrides of Tailwind classes and ensuring that the component's structure does not interfere with Tailwind's processing.
