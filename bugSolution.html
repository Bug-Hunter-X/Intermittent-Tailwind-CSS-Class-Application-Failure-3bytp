After thorough investigation, I discovered that the issue stemmed from an unintended style conflict. A custom CSS rule with high specificity was inadvertently overriding the Tailwind classes in the affected component. By either modifying the custom CSS rule to have lower specificity or using the !important flag (as a last resort) on the Tailwind classes within the problematic component, the issue was resolved.  This highlights the importance of understanding CSS specificity and carefully considering potential style conflicts when using frameworks like Tailwind CSS.
